# Identifying 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) signatures in circulating cell-free DNA and treatment response in multiple myeloma with a machine learning approach

This project is part of my doctoral dissertation, which is steadily taking shapeâ€”exciting times! Below is a poster based on this work, presented at the 2024 ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition. I will add more sharable content under this project once I get a chance.
